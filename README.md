# outline-indent.el - Emacs Package to Outline and Fold Text Using Indentation Levels

The `outline-indent.el` Emacs package provides a minor mode that enables code folding and outlining based on indentation levels for various indentation-based text files, such as YAML, Python, and other indented text files.

In addition to code folding, `outline-indent.el` allows moving indented subtrees up and down, promoting and demoting sections to adjust indentation levels, customizing the ellipsis, and inserting a new line with the same indentation level as the current line, among other features.

The `outline-indent.el` package leverages the built-in *outline-minor-mode*, which is maintained by the Emacs developers and has less chance of being abandoned like *origami.el*.

The `outline-indent.el` Emacs package offers a similar functionality to Vim's `set foldmethod=indent` setting. Just as in Vim, it allows to fold and unfold code sections based on their indentation levels.

## Installation

### Install using straight

To install the `outline-indent` using `straight.el`:

1. If you haven't already done so, [add the straight.el bootstrap code](https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) to your init file.

2. Add the following code to your Emacs init file:
```
(use-package outline-indent
  :ensure t
  :straight (outline-indent
             :type git
             :host github
             :repo "jamescherti/outline-indent.el")
  :custom
  (outline-indent-ellipsis " â–¼ "))
```

## Activation

Once installed, the minor mode can be activated using:
```
(outline-indent-minor-mode)
```

The minor mode can also be automatically activated for a certain mode. For example for text-mode, Python, and YAML:
```
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'outline-indent-minor-mode)
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook #'outline-indent-minor-mode)
(add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook #'outline-indent-minor-mode)
(add-hook 'yaml-ts-mode-hook #'outline-indent-minor-mode)
```

## Usage

### Functions specific to outline-indent-minor-mode

#### outline-indent-promote and outline-indent-demote

*(By default, `outline-indent-advise-outline-functions` is set to t, which means that you can also use the built-in outline functions `(outline-promote)` and `(outline-demote)` instead of `(outline-indent-promote)` and `(outline-indent-demote)`)*

These functions can be used to indent or unindent the entire subtree.

To increase indentation:
```
(outline-indent-demote)
```

To decrease indentation:
```
(outline-indent-promote)
```
The global variable `outline-indent-default-offset` is used to determine the number of spaces to indent or unindent the subtree.

#### outline-indent-move-subtree-up and outline-indent-move-subtree-down

*(By default, `outline-indent-advise-outline-functions` is set to t, which means that you can also use the built-in outline functions `(outline-move-subtree-up)` and `(outline-move-subtree-down)`, instead of `(outline-indent-move-subtree-up)` and `(outline-indent-move-subtree-down)`)*

These functions can be used to move the current subtree down past ARGS headlines of the same level.

To move the subtree down, use:
```
(outline-indent-move-subtree-down)
```

To move the subtree up, use:
```
(outline-indent-move-subtree-up)
```

#### outline-indent-insert-heading

*(By default, `outline-indent-advise-outline-functions` is set to t, which means that you can also use the built-in outline function `outline-insert-heading` instead of `outline-indent-insert-heading`)*

The `(outline-indent-insert-heading)` function inserts a new line with the same indentation level/depth as the current line just before the next heading that shares the same or less indentation level. It finds the nearest non-empty line with the same or less indentation as the current line and inserts a new line before it.

In `outline-indent-minor-mode`, where most lines are treated as headings, this function is suitable for maintaining consistent indentation within the outline structure. It can be used as an alternative to `outline-insert-heading` to insert content at the same indentation level after the current fold.

Example usage:
```
(outline-indent-insert-heading)
```

If you are an Emacs Evil user, you may want to make `C-<return>` call the function above and switch to insert mode:

``` emacs-lisp
(evil-define-key '(normal insert) outline-indent-minor-mode-map
  (kbd "C-<return>")
  (defun my-evil-outline-indent-insert-heading ()
    (interactive)
    (outline-indent-insert-heading)
    (evil-insert-state)))
```

### Vanilla Emacs

Use the standard `outline-mode`/`outline-minor-mode` commands to fold and unfold sections of your indented file:
- `outline-hide-body`: Hide all body lines in buffer, leaving all headings visible.
- `outline-hide-other`: Hide everything except current body and parent and top-level headings.
- `outline-hide-entry`: Hide the body directly following this heading.
- `outline-hide-leaves`: Hide the body after this heading and at deeper levels.
- `outline-hide-subtree`: Hide everything after this heading at deeper levels.
- `outline-show-children`: Show all direct subheadings of this heading.
- `outline-hide-sublevels`: Hide everything but the top LEVELS levels of headers, in whole buffer.
- `outline-show-all`: Show all of the text in the buffer.
- `outline-show-entry`: Show the body directly following this heading.
- `outline-show-subtree`: Show everything after this heading at deeper levels.
- `outline-show-branches`: Show all subheadings of this heading, but not their bodies.
- `outline-show-children`: Show all direct subheadings of this heading.

### Evil mode

In Evil mode, `outline-indent` works out of the box, and you can use the Evil keyboard mappings: zo, zc, zO, zC, za, zr, and zm to manage folds.

## Frequently asked questions

### Maintaining blank lines between folded sections

The `outline-blank-line` variable can be set to `t` (true) to maintain blank lines between folded sections, making it easier to distinguish between folds:

```
(setq outline-blank-line t)
```

### Why not use origami.el?

The `origami.el` package is no longer actively maintained and has known bugs that can affect its reliability and performance.

On the other hand, `outline-indent.el` leverages the built-in `outline-minor-mode`, which is actively maintained by the Emacs developers.
